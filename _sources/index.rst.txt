KALMAN FILTER
=============
General multidimensional implementation of the Kalman filter algorithm using 
NumPy. The Kalman filter is an optimal estimation algorithm, and it is optimal 
in the sense of reducing the expected squared error of the parameters.

The standard Kalman filter estimates a process by using a form of feedback 
control loop: time update (predict) and measurement update (correct/update).
